Such changes may mean there is debris flow activity upstream so be prepared to move quickly.{'\n'}

        <Text style={{color: 'orange'}}>&#8226;</Text> Watch for flooding, which may occur after a landslide or debris flow. Floods sometimes follow landslides and debris flows because they may both be started by the same event.{'\n'}
        <Text style={{color: 'orange'}}>&#8226;</Text> Look for and report broken utility lines to appropriate authorities. Reporting potential hazards will get the utilities turned off as quickly as possible, preventing further hazard and injury.{'\n'}
        <Text style={{color: 'orange'}}>&#8226;</Text> Check the building foundation, chimney, and surrounding land for damage. Damage to foundations, chimneys, or surrounding land may help you assess the safety of the area.{'\n'}
        <Text style={{color: 'orange'}}>&#8226;</Text> Replant damaged ground as soon as possible since erosion caused by loss of ground cover can lead to flash flooding.{'\n'}
        <Text style={{color: 'orange'}}>&#8226;</Text> Seek the advice of a geotechnical expert for evaluating landslide hazards or designing corrective techniques to reduce landslide risk. A professional will be able to advise you of the best ways to prevent or reduce landslide risk, without creating further hazard.{'\n'}{'\n'}
