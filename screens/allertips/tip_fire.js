        &#8226; DON'T ever smoke in bed, when drowsy or medicated, or if anyone in the home is using oxygen.{'\n'}
        &#8226; DO talk to children regularly about the dangers of fire, matches and lighters and keep them out of reach.{'\n'}

        &#8226; Install smoke alarms on every level of your home and outside every sleeping area. {'\n'}
        &#8226; Install a carbon monoxide alarm in a central location outside each separate sleeping area. {'\n'}
        &#8226; Make sure your house number is easily readable from the street, even at night.{'\n'}
        &#8226; Make sure your home heating sources are clean and in working order. Many home fires are started by poorly maintained furnaces or stoves, cracked or rusted furnace parts, or chimneys with creosote buildup. {'\n'}
        &#8226; Use kerosene heaters only if permitted by law. Refuel kerosene heaters only outdoors and after they have cooled.{'\n'}
        &#8226; Check electrical wiring in your home:{'\n'}
        &#8226; Fix or replace frayed extension cords, exposed wires, or loose plugs.{'\n'}
        &#8226; Make sure wiring is not under rugs, attached by nails, or in high traffic areas.{'\n'}
        &#8226; Make sure electrical outlets have cover plates and no exposed wiring.{'\n'}
        &#8226; Avoid overloading outlets or extension cords.{'\n'}
        &#8226; Purchase only appliances and electrical devices (including space heaters) that bear the label of an independent testing laboratory.{'\n'}
        &#8226; Store combustible materials in open areas away from heat sources. Place rags used to apply flammable household chemicals in metal containers with tight-fitting lids. {'\n'}

      <Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Guard Against Kitchen Fires</Text>{'\n'}
        &#8226; Stay in the kitchen when frying, grilling or broiling food. Stay in the home while simmering, baking, roasting or boiling food.{'\n'}
        &#8226; Keep pets off cooking surfaces and countertops.{'\n'}
        &#8226; Keep the stove area clean and clear of things that can catch fire, such as pot holders, towels, curtains, bags, and other appliances.{'\n'}
        &#8226; If you are cooking and a fire starts in a pan, slide a lid over the burning pan and turn off the burner. Leave the lid in place until the pan is completely cool. Moving the pan can cause serious injury or spread the fire. Never pour water on grease fires.{'\n'}

        &#8226; Know how to safely operate a fire extinguisher{'\n'}
        &#8226; Remember to GET OUT, STAY OUT and CALL 9-1-1 or your local emergency phone number.{'\n'}
        &#8226; Yell "Fire!" several times and go outside right away. If you live in a building with elevators, use the stairs. Leave all your things where they are and save yourself.{'\n'}
        &#8226; If closed doors or handles are warm or smoke blocks your primary escape route, use your second way out. Never open doors that are warm to the touch.{'\n'}
        &#8226; If you must escape through smoke, get low and go under the smoke to your exit. Close doors behind you.{'\n'}
        &#8226; If smoke, heat or flames block your exit routes, stay in the room with doors closed. Place a wet towel under the door and call the fire department or 9-1-1. Open a window and wave a brightly colored cloth or flashlight to signal for help.{'\n'}
        &#8226; Once you are outside, go to your meeting place and then send one person to call the fire department. If you cannot get to your meeting place, follow your family emergency communication plan.{'\n'}{'\n'}
        <Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>If your clothes catch on fire:</Text>{'\n'}
        &#8226; Stop what you’re doing.{'\n'}
        &#8226; Drop to the ground and cover your face if you can.{'\n'}
        &#8226; Roll over and over or back and forth until the flames go out. Running will only make the fire burn faster.{'\n'}{'\n'}
        <Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Once the flames are out, cool the burned skin with water for three to five minutes. Call for medical attention.</Text>{'\n'}
