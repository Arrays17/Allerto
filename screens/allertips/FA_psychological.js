        People are often shocked at the scene of an accident. Accidents, getting severely injured or falling severely ill can often cause people to be mentally hurt, in addition to physical injuries.{'\n\n'}
        The objective of psychological first aid is to calm down, comfort and process what happened. This way, the victim and their family members are helped to cope and move on after the event. Calm and determined actions by the helper will provide a feeling of safety.{'\n\n'}

        Most come through shocking experiences by themselves and with the help of their friends and loved ones. Family, friends, and colleagues are crucial for a personâ€™s coping.{'\n'}
        Sometimes, however, professional help is needed. The need may arise after a longer period of time and take the following forms, for example:{'\n'}
        {'\t'} <Text style={{color: 'orange'}}>&#8226;</Text> Difficulties sleeping.{'\n'}
        {'\t'} <Text style={{color: 'orange'}}>&#8226;</Text> Difficulties concentrating.{'\n'}
        {'\t'} <Text style={{color: 'orange'}}>&#8226;</Text> Unexplained physical symptoms (headache, stomach symptoms, etc.).{'\n'}
        {'\t'} <Text style={{color: 'orange'}}>&#8226;</Text> Isolation and loneliness.{'\n'}
        {'\t'} <Text style={{color: 'orange'}}>&#8226;</Text> Difficulties with everyday routines.{'\n'}
        {'\t'} <Text style={{color: 'orange'}}>&#8226;</Text> Excessive use of alcohol and medication.{'\n'}
        {'\t'} <Text style={{color: 'orange'}}>&#8226;</Text> Suicidal thoughts.{'\n\n'}
        Help is available through helplines, the health centre, or a hospital, for example. Never leave the person in need of help alone with their injuries or symptoms.{'\n\n'}
