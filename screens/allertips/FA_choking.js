        <Text style={s.tipContent}>Choking occurs when a foreign object lodges in the throat or windpipe, blocking the flow of air. In adults, a piece of food often is the culprit. Young children often swallow small objects. Because choking cuts off oxygen to the brain, give first aid as quickly as possible.{'\n'}</Text>

        1. Support the personâ€™s body and bend their upper body downwards. Then, slap them firmly between the shoulder blades five times.{'\n'}
        2. If the foreign object is not removed from the throat and you are alone, call 911.{'\n'}
        3. Continue first aid with abdominal thrusts, i.e. the Heimlich manoeuvre. Stand behind the person and place one fist below their diaphragm. Grab your fist with your other hand. Thrust sharply inwards and upwards. Repeat five times, if necessary.{'\n'}
        4. If the obstruction is not removed, alternate between five slaps between the shoulder blades and five thrusts.{'\n'}
        5. Start resuscitation if the person loses consciousness and is not breathing normally. Notify the Emergency Response Centre about the change in the situation. {'\n\n'}
